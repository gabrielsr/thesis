\section{Runtime Goal Model}
Early requirements models express what are the stakeholder goals and needed functionality. This models are a tool for common communication with various stakeholders by abstracting details that are irrelevant at this level\cite{dalpiaz_runtime_2013}.

Dalpiaz et al.\cite{dalpiaz_runtime_2013} describe a method for extend Design-time Goal Models (DGMs) to create Runtime Goal Models (RGM). RGMs can be used to analyze the system's runtime behavior.

At runtime, system behavior is characterized by \textit{events}, related to \textit{goal instances}.
