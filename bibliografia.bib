	abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to introduce and motivate a methodology, called {\textbackslash}emph\{Tropos\}, for building agent oriented software systems. Tropos is based on two key ideas. First, the notion of agent and all the related mentalistic notions (for instance: beliefs, goals, actions and plans) are used in all phases of software development, from the early analysis down to the actual implementation.  Second, Tropos covers also the very early phases of requirements analysis, thus allowing for a deeper understanding of the environment where the software must operate, and of the kind of interactions that should occur between software and human agents. The methodology is illustrated with the help of a case study.},

The authors introduce a hierarchical agent-based system architecture, which enables self-organization and self-adaptation upon parallel embedded systems. Self-organization is achieved by dynamic clusterization, which groups self-aware components into a cluster and continuously updates the organization to account for application changes and internal errors. Self-adaptation is performed by hierarchical agents, based on the run-time organization, to monitor corresponding levels of components and reconfigure the system to improve energy efficiency and dependability. The system architecture achieves functional scalability via partitioning of agent intelligence, and physical scalability via level-specific software/hardware co-design of agents.},

However, this assumption no longer works within today's unpredictable open-world settings, especially in ubiquitous and pervasive computing settings, which demand techniques that let software react to changes by self-organizing its structure and self-adapting its behavior. The more we move toward dynamic and heterogeneous systems, and the more we stress their self-healing and self-adapting capabilities, the more we need new approaches to develop these applications and new ways to structure and program them. Programming open systems requires new programming language features. Two features that bear investigation are introspection mechanisms to get runtime information about newly encountered services and reflective mechanisms to adapt client applications dynamically. Some existing standards, industrial products, and research prototypes that support, to a certain extent, the open-world assumptions are service-oriented technologies, publish/subscribe middleware systems, grid infrastructures, autonomic frameworks},

Due to the dynamic nature of the field many challenging requirements are continuously emerging. One of them relates to the possibility to support collaborative activities that demand sharing resources between students and their mobile devices in constantly changing conditions. These situations generate the need of using decentralized distributed architectures in which mobile devices can share resources to carry out the activity covering the concerns defined by the different stakeholders. This paper describes our current efforts connected to identifying a set of requirements for M-Learning activities. Thereafter, we elaborate on why a decentralized distributed system (DDS) can be used to provide a novel solution to tackle the mentioned above problems. Moreover, initial aspects related to the design of a DDS, including a self-adaptation mechanism are presented.},

Architectural design decisions that conflict with deploy ability goals can impede the team's ability to achieve the desired state of deployment and may result in substantial technical debt. To explore this assertion, we interviewed three project teams striving to practicing continuous delivery. In this paper, we summarize examples of the deploy ability goals for each project as well as the architectural decisions that they have made to enable deploy ability. We present the deploy ability goals, design decisions, and deploy ability tactics collected and summarize the design tactics derived from the interviews in the form of an initial draft version hierarchical deploy ability tactic tree.},

	abstract = {Highlights¿ We show one way of rationally coming up with a suitable design for a private cloud. ¿ Stakeholder goals are identified early, analyzed and used to drive the proposed process. ¿ Cloud Computing simulations are used iteratively and in an interleaving manner to evaluate design decisions. ¿ The proposed approach borrows heavily from existing techniques in Software Engineering. The fast-growing Cloud Computing paradigm makes it possible to use unprecedented amounts of computing resources at lower costs, among other benefits such as fast provisioning and reliability. In designing a good architecture - the numbers, types and layouts of devices - for a cloud-based system, which meets the goals of all stakeholders, such goals need to be factored in from the earliest stages. However, there seems to be a lack of methodologies for incorporating stakeholder goals into the design process for such systems, and for assuring with higher confidence that the designs are likely to be good enough for the stated goals. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented simulation approach for cloud-based system design whereby stakeholder goals are captured, together with such domain characteristics as workflows, and used in creating a simulation model as a proxy for the cloud-based system architecture. Simulations are then run, in an interleaving manner, against various configurations of the model as a way of rationally exploring, evaluating and selecting among incrementally better architectural alternatives. We illustrate important aspects of this approach for the private cloud deployment model and report on our experiments, using a smartcard-based public transportation system.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to the design of self-adaptive service-oriented applications based on a new model called service tiles. The approach allows designers to develop a service-oriented system by building an assembly of component services that accomplishes the given goal. The assembly is computed automatically starting from the specification of a subset of the whole system, a few constraints, and the goals the application should fulfill. An application designed according to the service-tile model can also dynamically self-adapt by replacing, in part or entirely, services in the assembly whenever they fail or the application context changes. The service-tile design technique has been implemented in a prototype and some experiments with several examples demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and its practical efficiency.},

There is growing demand for software systems able to self-reconfigure, and specifically systems that can fulfill their requirements in dynamic environments. We propose a conceptual architecture that provides systems with self-reconfiguration capabilities, enacting a model-based adaptation process based on requirements models. We describe the logical view on our architecture for self-reconfiguration, then we detail the main mechanisms to monitor for and diagnose failures. We present a case study where a self-reconfiguring system assists a patient perform daily tasks, such as getting breakfast, within her home. The challenge for the system is to fulfill its mission regardless of the context, also to compensate for failures caused by patient inaction or other omissions in the environment of the system.},

	abstract = {Autonomous systems need to support dynamic software adaptation in order to handle the complexity and unpredictability of the execution environment, and the changing needs of the end user. Although a number of approaches have been proposed, few address a key issue: that of distribution. In this paper we seek to overcome the limitations of centralised approaches. We build on our previous work on adaptive self-assembly within the three-layer model for autonomous systems to provide a decentralised technique for self-assembly. To achieve this in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner, we use a gossip protocol as a basis. While no central or leader node is aware of the full space of solutions, gossip ensures that agreement on a particular solution - in this case a component configuration - is reached in a logarithmic number of steps with respect to the size of the network.},

	abstract = {Mobile applications are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and provide ever richer functionality on mobile devices. At the same time, such devices often enjoy strong connectivity with more powerful machines ranging from laptops and desktops to commercial clouds. This paper presents the design and implementation of CloneCloud, a system that automatically transforms mobile applications to benefit from the cloud. The system is a flexible application partitioner and execution runtime that enables unmodified mobile applications running in an application-level virtual machine to seamlessly off-load part of their execution from mobile devices onto device clones operating in a computational cloud. CloneCloud uses a combination of static analysis and dynamic profiling to partition applications automatically at a fine granularity while optimizing execution time and energy use for a target computation and communication environment. At runtime, the application partitioning is effected by migrating a thread from the mobile device at a chosen point to the clone in the cloud, executing there for the remainder of the partition, and re-integrating the migrated thread back to the mobile device. Our evaluation shows that CloneCloud can adapt application partitioning to different environments, and can help some applications achieve as much as a 20x execution speed-up and a 20-fold decrease of energy spent on the mobile device.},

The deployed application is instrumented to allow subsequent autonomic management. If, during execution, the manager detects that the original goal is no longer being met, the satisfy/deploy process can be repeated automatically in order to generate a revised deployment that does meet the goal.},

A SoS offers functions to users that cannot be provided by its individual parts, but emerge as a combination of these. However, providing these functions with a required level of quality is difficult due to inherent uncertainties, such as systems that attach and detach at will and faults that are difficult to predict. Self-adaptation is a well-studied approach that enables a system to reason about itself and adapt to achieve particular quality objectives in the face of uncertainties and change. However, the inherently decentralized nature of SoS raises fundamental challenges to self-adaptation. This paper presents three architectural styles to realize self-adaptation in SoS, discusses key challenges for each style, and outlines starting points that could help to tackle these challenges.},

In particular, they need to be flexible in order to cope with dynamism in different forms (e.g. service and data providers and consumers). The current trend to build applications out of remote services makes the availability of constituent application components inherently dynamic. Developers can no longer assume that applications are static after development or at run time. Unfortunately, developing applications that are able to cope with dynamism is very complex. Existing development approaches do not provide explicit support for managing dynamism. In this paper we describe Rondo, a tool suite for designing pervasive applications. More specifically, we present our propositions in pervasive application specification, which borrows concepts from service-oriented component assembly, model-driven engineering (MDE) and continuous deployment, resulting in a more flexible approach than traditional application definitions. Then the capabilities of our application model are demonstrated with an example application scenario designed using our approach.},

	abstract = {E-Health systems need to dynamically integrate a huge variety of medical sensors in order to provide a meaningful survey of a patient's condition. Devices like smart phones or gateways usually used as integrators, often underlie resource constraints and have to cope with the mobility of the patient. Therefore it is difficult to realize an overall integration middleware, that allows to handle a sufficient amount of medical sensors and is able to quickly adapt to changing requirements (e.g. new sensors or data aggregation modules) while preserving mobility and resource constraints. We present a middleware solution for the integration of medical devices and the aggregation of resulting data streams, that is able to adapt itself to the requirements of patients and Care Delivery Operators, using a modular approach and external knowledge repositories. Knowledge in the shape of configurations and runtime pluggable software modules is used to properly integrate and handle discovered medical devices on demand.},

	abstract = {The growing interest in adaptive software systems has resulted in a number of different proposals for the design of adaptive systems. Some approaches adopt architectural models, whereas others model adaptation options, at the level of requirements. This dichotomy has motivated us to perform a comparative study between two proposals for the design of adaptive systems: the Rainbow Framework (architecture-based) and our own proposal, Zanshin (requirements-based). This evaluation paper reports on our methodology and results. It also provides a comparison between the use of architectural and requirements models as centrepieces of adaptation, offering guidelines for the future research in the field of adaptive systems.},

Thus, they provide the resources for what we envision as a human pervasive network: a network formed by user devices, suitable to convey to users rich multimedia content and services according to their interests and needs. Similar to opportunistic networks, where the communication is built on connectivity opportunities, we envisage a network above these resources that joins together features of traditional pervasive networks and opportunistic networks fostering a new computing paradigm: opportunistic computing. In this article we discuss the evolution from opportunistic networking to opportunistic computing; we survey key recent achievements in opportunistic networking, and describe the main concepts and challenges of opportunistic computing. We finally envision further possible scenarios and functionalities to make opportunistic computing a key player in the next-generation Internet.},

In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development.

Most areas of computer science research, such as programming language implementation, distributed operating system design, or denotational semantics, are defined largely by technical problems, and driven by building upon and elaborating a body of past results. Ubiquitous computing, by contrast, encompasses a wide range of disparate technological areas brought together by a focus upon a common vision. It is driven, then, not so much by the problems of the past but by the possibilities of the future. Ubiquitous computing’s vision, however, is over a decade old at this point, and we now inhabit the future imagined by its pioneers. The future, though, may not have worked out as the field collectively imagined. In this article, we explore the vision that has driven the ubiquitous computing research agenda and the contemporary practice that has emerged. Drawing on cross-cultural investigations of technology adoption, we argue for developing a “ubicomp of the present” which takes the messiness of everyday life as a central theme.},

The increasing demand for complex networked software, which makes computing resources available to anyone, anywhere and at any time, is drawing attention to the engineering of self-adaptive software. The objective of our work is to define a process and a tool-supported design framework to develop self-adaptive systems, which consider Belief-Desire-Intention agent models as reference architectures. We adopt an agent-oriented approach, which allows to explicitly model system goals in requirements specification and in the system architecture design. Moreover, goal achievement conditions are specified along with their relationships with the environment and with possible failures, and corresponding recovery actions.

	abstract = {Resource management in Cloud Computing has been dominated by system-level virtual machines to enable the management of resources using a coarse grained approach, largely in a manner independent from the applications running on these infrastructures. However, in such environments, although different types of applications can be running, the resources are delivered equally to each one, missing the opportunity to manage the available resources in a more efficient and application driven way. So, as more applications target managed runtimes, high level virtualization is a relevant abstraction layer that has not been properly explored to enhance resource usage, control, and effectiveness. We propose a VM economics model to manage cloud infrastructures, governed by a quality-of-execution (QoE) metric and implemented by an extended virtual machine. The Adaptive and Resource-Aware Java Virtual Machine (ARA-JVM) is a cluster-enabled virtual execution environment with the ability to monitor base mechanisms (e.g. thread cheduling, garbage collection, memory or network consumptions) to assess application's performance and reconfigure these mechanisms in runtime according to previously defined resource allocation policies. Reconfiguration is driven by incremental gains in quality-of-execution (QoE), used by the VM economics model to balance relative resource savings and perceived performance degradation. Our work in progress, aims to allow cloud providers to exchange resource slices among virtual machines, continually addressing where those resources are required, while being able to determine where the reduction will be more economically effective, i.e., will contribute in lesser extent to performance degradation.},

This aggravates the need for a socio-technical perspective for requirements engineering, which allows for modelling and analyzing the composition and interaction of hardware and software components with human and organizational actors. In this setting, alternative requirements models have to be evaluated and selected finding a right trade-off between the technical and social dimensions. To address this problem, we propose a tool-supported process of requirements analysis for socio-technical systems, which adopts planning techniques for exploring the space of requirements alternatives and a number of social criteria for their evaluation. We illustrate the proposed approach with the help of a case study, conducted within the context of an EU project.},

Goal-oriented requirements engineering is concerned with the use of goals for eliciting, elaborating, structuring, specifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting, and modifying requirements. This area has received increasing attention over the past few years. The paper reviews various research efforts undertaken along this line of research. The arguments in favor of goal orientation are first briefly discussed. The paper then com-pares the main approaches to goal modeling, goal specification and goal-based reasoning in the many activities of the requirements engineering process. To make the discussion more concrete, a real case study is used to suggest what a goal-oriented requirements engineering method may look like. Experience with such approaches and tool support are briefly discussed as well.},

	abstract = {Several agent-oriented software engineering methodologies address the emerging challenges posed by the increasing need of adaptive software. A common denominator of such methodologies is the paramount importance of the concept of goal model in order to understand the requirements of a software system. Goal models consist of goal graphs representing AND/OR-decomposition of abstract goals down to operationalisable leaf-level goals. Goal models are used primarily in the earlier phases of software engineering, for social modelling, requirements elicitation and analysis, to concretise abstract objectives, to detail them and to capture alternatives for their satisfaction. Although various agent programming languages incorporate the notion of (leaf-level) goal as a language construct, none of them natively support the definition of goal models. However, the semantic gap between goal models used at design-time and the concept of goal used at implementation and execution time represent a limitation especially in the development of self-adaptive and fault-tolerant systems. In such systems, design-time knowledge on goals and variability becomes relevant at run-time, to take autonomous decisions for achieving high level objectives correctly. Recently, unifying operational semantics for (leaf) goals have been proposed [15]. We extend this work to define an operational semantics for the behaviour of goals in goal models, maintaining the flexibility of using different goal types and conditions. We use a simple example to illustrate how the proposed approach effectively deals with the semantic gap between design-time goal models and run-time agent implementations.},

This higher level of system complexity has triggered the birth of several software engineering methodologies that adopt the agent paradigm. Design patterns are a well known approach for capturing and reusing knowledge related to known solution for recurrent architectural problems. Even though the importance of patterns is growing as systems become more and more complex, their development does not keep up with the evolving requirements, as traditional agent patterns are unable to support the majority of current complex social scenarios. This work motivates the need for new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible than traditional agent patterns such as, Broker and Matchmaker. The newly suggested structure supports the dynamic nature of “Active Environment” where groups of agents are formed for service delivery and then dissolved with no central coordinating mechanism—i.e., gaining the disintermediation property. Serving as a case study, the PEACH and PIL projects have paved the way for experimenting with the new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible and more suitable than traditional agent patterns for coping with ambient intelligence scenarios.},

Due to the high potential of emergencies, a sound emergency assistance is required, for instance assisting elderly people with comprehensive ambient assisted living solutions sets high demands on the overall system quality and consequently on software and system engineering - user acceptance and support by various userinterfaces is an absolute necessity.

	abstract = {In statistics, a Q–Q plot ("Q" stands for quantile) is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. First, the set of intervals for the quantiles is chosen. A point (x,y) on the plot corresponds to one of the quantiles of the second distribution (y-coordinate) plotted against the same quantile of the first distribution (x-coordinate). Thus the line is a parametric curve with the parameter which is the (number of the) interval for the quantile.
If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on the line y = x. If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q–Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line y = x. Q–Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a location-scale family of distributions.
A Q–Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions. Q–Q plots can be used to compare collections of data, or theoretical distributions. The use of Q–Q plots to compare two samples of data can be viewed as a non-parametric approach to comparing their underlying distributions. A Q–Q plot is generally a more powerful approach to do this than the common technique of comparing histograms of the two samples, but requires more skill to interpret. Q–Q plots are commonly used to compare a data set to a theoretical model. This can provide an assessment of "goodness of fit" that is graphical, rather than reducing to a numerical summary. Q–Q plots are also used to compare two theoretical distributions to each other. Since Q–Q plots compare distributions, there is no need for the values to be observed as pairs, as in a scatter plot, or even for the numbers of values in the two groups being compared to be equal.
The term "probability plot" sometimes refers specifically to a Q–Q plot, sometimes to a more general class of plots, and sometimes to the less commonly used P–P plot. The probability plot correlation coefficient is a quantity derived from the idea of Q–Q plots, which measures the agreement of a fitted distribution with observed data and which is sometimes used as a means of fitting a distribution to data.},

This assumption is no longer valid in emerging computing paradigms, such as ambient, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, where it is essential to monitor and adapt to an inherently varying context. Besides influencing the software, context may influence stakeholders’ goals and their choices to meet them. In this paper, we propose a goal-oriented RE modeling and reasoning framework for systems operating in varying contexts. We introduce contextual goal models to relate goals and contexts; context analysis to refine contexts and identify ways to verify them; reasoning techniques to derive requirements reflecting the context and users priorities at runtime; and finally, design time reasoning techniques to derive requirements for a system to be developed at minimum cost and valid in all considered contexts. We illustrate and evaluate our approach through a case study about a museum-guide mobile information system.},

They allow expressing event-based multi-agent, providing environment, and messaging, execution and sensor services. The development of agent based applications is difficult, suffering from insufficient standards and tools and on the other hand deployment issues are little researched and supported. The cooperation in multi-agent systems is one of the most important features that can be understood in many ways. In the paper is suggested that the designers must make the cooperation possible using appropriate tools. Urban traffic problems are very complex and highly interactive. The multi-agent systems (MAS) approach may however provide a new hopeful direction. Ontology is a mandatory concept in MAS. A simulation system is needed to understand and explore the difficulties in a MAS-based traffic control. In the paper we propose a mode},

Due to new computing trends, such as pervasive computing, miniaturization of IT leads to mobile devices with the emerging need for context adaptation. Therefore, it is beneficial that devices are able to adapt context. Hence, we propose to extend the definition of SASs and include context adaptation. This paper presents a taxonomy of self-adaptation and a survey on engineering SASs. Based on the taxonomy and the survey, we motivate a new perspective on SAS including context adaptation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Self-adaptive software is capable of evaluating and changing its own behavior, whenever the evaluation shows that the software is not accomplishing what it was intended to do, or when better functionality or performance may be possible. The topic of system adaptivity has been widely studied since the mid-60s and, over the past decade, several application areas and technologies relating to self-adaptivity have assumed greater importance. In all these initiatives, software has become the common element that introduces self-adaptability. Thus, the investigation of systematic software engineering approaches is necessary, in order to develop self-adaptive systems that may ideally be applied across multiple domains. The main goal of this study is to review recent progress on self-adaptivity from the standpoint of computer sciences and cybernetics, based on the analysis of state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. This review provides an over-arching, integrated view of computer science and software engineering foundations. Moreover, various methods and techniques currently applied in the design of self-adaptive systems are analyzed, as well as some European research initiatives and projects. Finally, the main bottlenecks for the effective application of self-adaptive technology, as well as a set of key research issues on this topic, are precisely identified, in order to overcome current constraints on the effective application of self-adaptivity in its emerging areas of application.},

In the experiment, we asked subjects to perform comprehension tasks on requirements specifications expressed in Tropos4AS and in Tropos, respectively. Results show that Tropos4AS is more effective than Tropos in describing requirements of self-adaptive systems, especially when the models are used by novice requirements engineers.},

	abstract = {Modern applications, e.g., for pervasive computing scenarios, are increasingly reliant on systems built from multiple distributed components, which must be suitably composed to meet some specified functional and non-functional requirements. A key challenge is how to efficiently and effectively manage such complex systems. The use of self-management capabilities has been suggested as a possible way to address this challenge. To cope with the scalability and robustness issues of large distributed systems, self-management should ideally be architected in a decentralised way, where the overall system behaviour emerges from local decisions and interactions. Within this context, we propose GOPRIME, a fully decentralised middleware solution for the adaptive self-assembly of distributed services. The GOPRIME goal is to build and maintain an assembly of services that, besides functional requirements, fulfills also global quality-of-service and structural requirements. The key aspect of GOPRIME is the use of a gossip protocol to achieve decentralised information dissemination and decision making. To show the validity of our approach, we present results from the experimentation of a prototype implementation of GOPRIME in a mobile health application, and an extensive set of simulation experiments that assess the effectiveness of GOPRIME in terms of scalability, robustness and convergence speed.},

Di\#erent components can be provided by di\#erent producers and they can be part of di\#erent systems at the same time. Moreover, components can change rapidly and independently, making it di\#cult to manage the whole system in a consistent way. Under these circumstances, a crucial step of the software life cycle is deployment---that is, the activities related to the release, installation, activation, deactivation, update, and removal of components, as well as whole systems. This paper presents a framework for characterizing technologies that are intended to support software deployment. The framework highlights four primary factors concerning the technologies: process coverage},

	title = {Improving the {Performance}, {Availability}, and {Security} of {Data} {Access} for {Opportunistic} {Mobile} {Computing}},
	abstract = {An opportunistic model of mobile computing is presently emerging in which users can fully benefit from their personal computing environment wherever they are without having to carry "heavy-weight" mobile systems with them. The transition to this model can be seen as part of the pervasive computing vision, being catalyzed by the near ubiquity of powerful smart phones, the increasing availability of local PC hardware, and recent trends in virtualization and cloud computing. The fate of the opportunistic mobile computing model will be essentially decided by the performance, availability, and security of data access relative to alternative solutions. Mobile users require safe and efficient access to their data from whatever PC or device they are currently using, wherever they may be. These requirements expose several new challenges to the performance, availability, and security of user data access under opportunistic mobile computing conditions.In this dissertation, we identify challenges to user data access within the opportunistic mobile computing model, present novel approaches to address them, and demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches through extensive experimentation. To improve the performance of data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the concept of safe borrowing of local storage, which we prototyped as the TransPart system. To improve the availability of data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the concept of a self-cleaning portable cache, which we prototyped as the Horatio system. To improve the security of remote data access for opportunistic mobile computing, we introduce the Working Set-Based Access Control (WSBAC) scheme, which applies the concept of the working set to distributed file system access control.The main conclusion of our research is that opportunistic mobile computing can be realized in a safe and efficient manner for mobile users. Given the ad-hoc nature of opportunistic mobile computing, it is likely that the challenges identified in this dissertation will continue to exist into the foreseeable future. Fortunately, as our research shows, they can be addressed using nascent technologies and applying our concepts without violating the basic tenet of opportunistic mobile computing, namely to minimize the burden of what hardware users must carry.},

Such models are used to simulate the behaviour of human entities such as submarine commanders, fighter pilots and infantry, with a view to producing realistic predictions about tactical outcomes. Tactics specify the means of achieving mission objectives, and should capture both reactive and deliberative behaviour. The lack of a methodology and supporting tools for designing computer-based models of tactics makes them difficult to create, maintain and reuse, and this is now a significant problem in military simulation domains. To address this, we have developed TDF (Tactics Development Framework), a tactics modelling methodology and tool based on the BDI (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) paradigm, that supports agent-oriented structural modelling of tactics and related artefacts including missions, storylines, goals and plans. The methodology was initially assessed by analysts in the undersea warfare domain, and was subsequently evaluated using a simple scenario in the autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles domain. The latter evaluation involved a comparison with UML designs, indicating that our methodology provides significant benefits to those building and maintaining models of tactical decision-making.},

The reason for this is not least due to the advent of computing trends like ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being open and adaptive, it is a common requirement for such systems to be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art ones, are not sufficient in this context. We have recently developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this article we show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end, we present in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models finally support dynamic safety evaluations.},

	abstract = {Distributed protocols executing in uncertain environments, like the Internet or ambient computing systems, should dynamically adapt to environment changes in order to preserve Quality of Service (QoS). In earlier work, it was shown that QoS adaptation should be dependable, if correctness of protocol properties is to be maintained. More recently, some ideas concerning specific strategies and methodologies for improving QoS adaptation have been proposed. In this article we describe Adaptare, a complete framework for dependable QoS adaptation. We assume that during its lifetime, a system alternates periods where its temporal behavior is well characterized, with transition periods during which a variation of the environment conditions occurs. Our method is based on the following: if the environment is generically characterized in analytical terms, and we can detect the alternation of these stable and transient phases, we can improve the effectiveness and dependability of QoS adaptation. To prove our point we provide detailed evaluation results of the proposed solutions. Our evaluation is based on synthetic data flows generated from probabilistic distributions, as well as on real data traces collected in various Internet-based environments. We compare our solution with other approaches and we show that Adaptare, albeit more complex, is very effective, allowing protocols to adapt to the available resources in a dependable way.},

A new version of a service should be adopted as soon as it becomes available to let clients benefit from the updated functionality and/or improved quality of service. In practice, however, existing services may be involved in distributed computations that cannot immediately adopt the new versions without suffering inconsistencies. The paper proposes a solution for the consistent runtime evolution of service-based business processes: new service versions can be adopted safely and in a timely fashion, and old versions can be consistently decommissioned. The proposal has been evaluated in the context of an online bank wire transfer example. Our experiments show that the approach is timely in activating service updates, and that the overhead it introduces is negligible.},

	abstract = {In a society where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) becomes a key component to improve the quality of our daily-life, systems' complexity dramatically increases to better accommodate to an inherent complexity of users' requirements, especially when dealing with pervasive computing. This poses demanding architectural requirements such as massive decentralization and disintermediation along with self-organizing properties. This higher level of system complexity has triggered the birth of several software engineering methodologies that adopt the agent paradigm. Design patterns are a well known approach for capturing and reusing knowledge related to known solution for recurrent architectural problems. Even though the importance of patterns is growing as systems become more and more complex, their development does not keep up with the evolving requirements, as traditional agent patterns are unable to support the majority of current complex social scenarios. This work motivates the need for new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible than traditional agent patterns such as, Broker and Matchmaker. The newly suggested structure supports the dynamic nature of “Active Environment” where groups of agents are formed for service delivery and then dissolved with no central coordinating mechanism—i.e., gaining the disintermediation property. Serving as a case study, the PEACH and PIL projects have paved the way for experimenting with the new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible and more suitable than traditional agent patterns for coping with ambient intelligence scenarios.},

	abstract = {Goal models capture stakeholder requirements for a system-to-be, but also circumscribe a space of alternative specifications for fulfilling these requirements. Recent proposals for self-adaptive software systems rely on variants of goal models to support monitoring and adaptation functions. In such cases, goal models serve as mechanisms in terms of which systems reflect upon their requirements during their operation. We argue that existing proposals for using goal models at runtime are using design artifacts for purposes they were not intended, i.e., for reasoning about runtime system behavior. In this paper, we propose a conceptual distinction between Design-time Goal Models (DGMs)-used to design a system-and Runtime Goal Models (RGMs)-used to analyze a system's runtime behavior with respect to its requirements. RGMs extend DGMs with additional state, behavioral and historical information about the fulfillment of goals. We propose a syntactic structure for RGMs, a method for deriving them from DGMs, and runtime algorithms that support their monitoring.},

In particular, we focus on changes in the service provider landscape in order to plug in interchangeably components and services providing the functionalities defined by the component framework. The dynamic adaptations are operated automatically for optimizing the application utility in a given execution context.

	abstract = {Developing modern distributed software systems is difficult in part because they have little control over the environments in which they execute. For example, hardware and software resources on which these systems rely may fail or become compromised and malicious. Redundancy can help manage such failures and compromises, but when faced with dynamic, unpredictable resources and attackers, the system reliability can still fluctuate greatly. Empowering the system with self-adaptive and self-managing reliability facilities can significantly improve the quality of the software system and reduce reliance on the developer predicting all possible failure conditions. We present iterative redundancy, a novel approach to improving software system reliability by automatically injecting redundancy into the system’s deployment. Iterative redundancy self-adapts in three ways: (1) by automatically detecting when the resource reliability drops, (2) by identifying unlucky parts of the computation that happen to deploy on disproportionately many compromised resources, and (3) by not relying on a priori estimates of resource reliability. Further, iterative redundancy is theoretically optimal in its resource use: Given a set of resources, iterative redundancy guarantees to use those resources to produce the most reliable version of that software system possible; likewise, given a desired increase in the system’s reliability, iterative redundancy guarantees achieving that reliability using the least resources possible. Iterative redundancy handles even the Byzantine threat model, in which compromised resources collude to attack the system. We evaluate iterative redundancy in three ways. First, we formally prove its self-adaptation, efficiency, and optimality properties. Second, we simulate it at scale using discrete event simulation. Finally, we modify the existing, open-source, volunteer-computing BOINC software system and deploy it on the globally-distributed PlanetLab- testbed network to empirically evaluate that iterative redundancy is self-adaptive and more efficient than existing techniques.},

	abstract = {Abstract Context: Many modern software systems must deal with changes and uncertainty. Traditional dependability requirements engineering is not equipped for this since it assumes that the context in which a system operates be stable and deterministic, which often leads to failures and recurrent corrective maintenance. The Contextual Goal Model (CGM), a requirements model that proposes the idea of context-dependent goal fulfillment, mitigates the problem by relating alternative strategies for achieving goals to the space of context changes. Additionally, the Runtime Goal Model (RGM) adds behavioral constraints to the fulfillment of goals that may be checked against system execution traces. Objective: This paper proposes \{GODA\} (Goal-Oriented Dependability Analysis) and its supporting framework as concrete means for reasoning about the dependability requirements of systems that operate in dynamic contexts. Method: \{GODA\} blends the power of CGM, \{RGM\} and probabilistic model checking to provide a formal requirements specification and verification solution. At design time, it can help with design and implementation decisions; at runtime it helps the system self-adapt by analyzing the different alternatives and selecting the one with the highest probability for the system to be dependable. \{GODA\} is integrated into TAO4ME, a state-of-the-art tool for goal modeling and analysis. Results: \{GODA\} has been evaluated against feasibility and scalability on Mobee: a real-life software system that allows people to share live and updated information about public transportation via mobile devices, and on larger goal models. \{GODA\} can verify, at runtime, up to two thousand leaf-tasks in less than 35ms, and requires less than 240 KB of memory. Conclusion: Presented results show GODA’s design-time and runtime verification capabilities, even under limited computational resources, and the scalability of the proposed solution.},

Contemporary mission-critical software systems are often expected to safely adapt to changes in their execution environment. Given the critical roles these systems play, it is often inconvenient to take them offline to adapt their functionality. Consequently, these systems are required, when feasible, to adapt their behavior at runtime with little or no human intervention. A promising approach to managing complexity in runtime environments is to develop adaptation mechanisms that leverage software models, referred to as models@run. time. Work on models@run.time seeks to extend the applicability of models produced in model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches to the runtime environment. Models@run. time is a causally connected self-representation of the associated system that emphasizes the structure, behavior, or goals of the system from a problem space perspective.},

	abstract = {Mobile platforms are becoming the predominant medium of access to Internet services due to the tremendous increase in their computation and communication capabilities. However, enabling applications that require real-time in-the-field data collection and processing using mobile platforms is still challenging due to i) the insufficient computing capabilities and unavailability of complete data on individual mobile devices and ii) the prohibitive communication cost and response time involved in offloading data to remote computing resources such as cloud datacenters for centralized computation. A novel resource provisioning framework for organizing the heterogeneous sensing, computing, and communication capabilities of static and mobile devices in the vicinity in order to form an elastic resource pool-a hybrid static/mobile computing grid (also called a loosely-coupled mobile device cloud)-is presented. This local computing grid can be harnessed to enable innovative data-and compute-intensive mobile applications such as ubiquitous context-aware health and wellness monitoring of the elderly, distributed rainfall and flood-risk estimation, distributed object recognition and tracking, and content-based distributed multimedia search and sharing. In orderto address challenges such as the inherent uncertainty in the hybrid grid (in terms of network connectivity and device availability), the proposed role-based resource provisioning framework is imparted with autonomic capabilities, namely, self-organization, self-optimization, and self-healing. A thorough experimental analysis aimed at verifying and demonstrating the benefits brought by autonomic capabilities of the framework is also presented in detail.},

	abstract = {E-Health systems need to dynamically integrate a huge variety of medical sensors in order to provide a meaningful survey of a patient's condition. Devices like smart phones or gateways usually used as integrators, often underlie resource constraints and have to cope with the mobility of the patient. Therefore it is difficult to realize an overall integration middleware, that allows to handle a sufficient amount of medical sensors and is able to quickly adapt to changing requirements (e.g. new sensors or data aggregation modules) while preserving mobility and resource constraints. We present a middleware solution for the integration of medical devices and the aggregation of resulting data streams, that is able to adapt itself to the requirements of patients and Care Delivery Operators, using a modular approach and external knowledge repositories. Knowledge in the shape of configurations and runtime pluggable software modules is used to properly integrate and handle discovered medical devices on demand.},

In this paper, we identify the need for resilient partitioning and propose the Resilient Actor model to structurally add this property to pervasive computing applications. Our model ensures that an application can be dynamically partitioned and it can always retract to the original or updated local state.},

The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

Software architects normally plan for change and put mechanisms in the architecture to support those changes. Understanding the situations where change has been planned for and recording the options possible within particular situations is usually not done explicitly. This becomes important if the architecture is used for many product versions over a long period or in a product line context where the architecture is used to build a variety of different products. That is, it is important to explicitly represent variation and indicate within the architecture locations for which change has been allowed.
We will describe how the management of variations in an architecture can be made more explicit and how the use of variation points connected to the choices a customer has when ordering a product can help to navigate to the appropriate places in the architecture.},

Second, Tropos covers also the very early phases of requirements analysis, thus allowing for a deeper understanding of the environment where the software must operate, and of the kind of interactions that should occur between software and human agents. The methodology is illustrated with the help of a case study. The Tropos language for conceptual modeling is formalized in a metamodel described with a set of UML class diagrams.},

Such models are used to simulate the behaviour of human entities such as submarine commanders, fighter pilots and infantry, with a view to producing realistic predictions about tactical outcomes. Tactics specify the means of achieving mission objectives, and should capture both reactive and deliberative behaviour. The lack of a methodology and supporting tools for designing computer-based models of tactics makes them difficult to create, maintain and reuse, and this is now a significant problem in military simulation domains. To address this, we have developed TDF (Tactics Development Framework), a tactics modelling methodology and tool based on the BDI (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) paradigm, that supports agent-oriented structural modelling of tactics and related artefacts including missions, storylines, goals and plans. The methodology was initially assessed by analysts in the undersea warfare domain, and was subsequently evaluated using a simple scenario in the autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles domain. The latter evaluation involved a comparison with UML designs, indicating that our methodology provides significant benefits to those building and maintaining models of tactical decision-making.},

In this paper we present the Multi-layer Collection and Constraint Language (mlCCL). It allows us to define how to collect, aggregate, and analyze runtime data in a multi-layered system. We also present ECoWare, a framework for event correlation and aggregation that supports mlCCL, and provides a dashboard for on-line and off-line drill-down analyses of collected data.

	abstract = {Deployment is a main development phase which configures a software to be ready for use in a certain environment. The ultimate goal of deployment is to enable users to achieve their requirements while using the deployed software. However, requirements are not uniform and differ between deployment environments. In one environment, certain requirements could be useless or redundant, thereby making some software functionalities superfluous. In another environment, instead, some requirements could be impossible to achieve and, thus, additional functionalities would be required. We advocate that ensuring fitness between requirements and the system environment is a basic and critical step to achieve a comprehensive deployment process. We propose a tool-supported modelling and analysis approach to tailor a requirements model to each environment in which the system is to be deployed. We study the case of a contextual goal model, which is a requirements model that captures the relationship between the variability of requirements (goal variability space) and the varying states of a deployment environment (context variability space). Our analysis relies on sampling a deployment environment to discover its context variability space and use it to identify loci in the contextual goal model where a modification has to take place. Finally, we apply our approach in practice and report on the obtained results.},

1  Introduction
 The goal of deployment is that software becomes ready for use in its environment and users find it a valid and efficient way to satisfy their requirements.
Argue that system correctly assembled and fitting its technical environment is only a part of the deployment process. Deployment has to ensure fitness between requirements and the system environment.
Software customization should be first studied at the requirements level.
 
 2 Background
Context affects whether a requirement needs to be achieved, restricts the space of adoptable alternatives to achieve it, and affects the quality of each of thesealternatives.
Need for weave together context and requirements.
Context analyses
* interesting description of a goal model in 3/4 page.
 
= Context refinement
context analysis should provide a systematic way to discover alternative sets of facts an actor needsto verify to judge if a context applies. 
We classify world predicates, based on their observability by an actor, into two types: facts and statements:
A world predicate F is a fact for an actor A iff F is observable by A.
A world predicate S is a statement for an actor A iff S is not observable by A. A statement S is supported by a formula of world predicates φ iff φ provides enough evidence to the truth of S
The support relation is an approximation that analysts introduce to infer the validity of a statement from monitorable facts. In turn, this enables to verify high-level contexts (expressed in business terms) from monitorable facts (expressed in physical terms).
 A context is monitorable if it can be specified in terms of facts and/or statements that are supported by facts

	abstract = {In pervasive computing, software applications vanish into the user's environment spreading their functionality to computers integrated into everyday devices. With the current state-of-the-art software tools, these characteristics put a great burden on programmers who have to enable the applications to dynamically partition across multiple devices, and to adapt such partitioning to frequent context changes such as network failures. This paper explores service partitioning techniques for development of pervasive computing applications. We propose a resilient actor model to structurally add service partitioning property to the pervasive applications. The service partitioning realised using resilient actor model happens at runtime, is user guided and the resulting partitioned application is retractable, and resilient to network failures.},

	abstract = {Requirements analysis includes a preliminary acquisition step where a global model for the specification of the system and its environment is elaborated. This model, called requirements model, involves concepts that are currently not supported by existing formal specification languages, such as goals to be achieved, agents to be assigned, alternatives to be negotiated, etc. The paper presents an approach to requirements acquisition which is driven by such higher-level concepts. Requirements models are acquired as instances of a conceptual meta-model. The latter can be represented as a graph where each node captures an abstraction such as, e.g., goal, action, agent, entity, or event, and where the edges capture semantic links between such abstractions. Well-formedness properties on nodes and links constrain their instances—that is, elements of requirements models. Requirements acquisition processes then correspond to particular ways of traversing the meta-model graph to acquire appropriate instances of the various nodes and links according to such constraints. Acquisition processes are governed by strategies telling which way to follow systematically in that graph; at each node specific tactics can be used to acquire the corresponding instances. The paper describes a significant portion of the meta-model related to system goals, and one particular acquisition strategy where the meta-model is traversed backwards from such goals. The meta-model and the strategy are illustrated by excerpts of a university library system.},

Drawing on the concept of self-awareness from psychology, this paper extends the foundation of software architecture styles for self-adaptive systems to arrive at a new principled approach for architecting self-aware systems.

	abstract = {Resource management in Cloud Computing has been dominated by system-level virtual machines to enable the management of resources using a coarse grained approach, largely in a manner independent from the applications running on these infrastructures. However, in such environments, although different types of applications can be running, the resources are delivered equally to each one, missing the opportunity to manage the available resources in a more efficient and application driven way. So, as more applications target managed runtimes, high level virtualization is a relevant abstraction layer that has not been properly explored to enhance resource usage, control, and effectiveness. We propose a VM economics model to manage cloud infrastructures, governed by a quality-of-execution (QoE) metric and implemented by an extended virtual machine. The Adaptive and Resource-Aware Java Virtual Machine (ARA-JVM) is a cluster-enabled virtual execution environment with the ability to monitor base mechanisms (e.g. thread cheduling, garbage collection, memory or network consumptions) to assess application's performance and reconfigure these mechanisms in runtime according to previously defined resource allocation policies. Reconfiguration is driven by incremental gains in quality-of-execution (QoE), used by the VM economics model to balance relative resource savings and perceived performance degradation. Our work in progress, aims to allow cloud providers to exchange resource slices among virtual machines, continually addressing where those resources are required, while being able to determine where the reduction will be more economically effective, i.e., will contribute in lesser extent to performance degradation.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing allows business users to scale up or down resource needs according to current demands (utility computing). Infrastructures for cloud computing can be distinguished with respect to the layer they operate on. In case of platform as a service (PAAS) frameworks are provided in order to simplify the construction of cloud applications relying on common base abstractions and tool sets. The focus of current PAAS frameworks is quite narrow and directed towards support for web applications and also visual tools for non-programmers. We envision that cloud computing can also substantially push forward typical enterprise applications if these applications are made to exploit cloud capabilities. In this paper we present an infrastructure for developing, deploying and managing distributed applications with the vision of distribution transparency in mind. The infrastructure is meant to be on PAAS layer but addresses developers instead of end users. It is founded on the active component paradigm for distributed applications, which allows applications being composed of agent-like autonomous entities interacting via services. The model facilitates building scalable and robust enterprise applications due to the high modularity and independently acting modules that can be replaced or restarted if unexpected errors occur. In addition to the infrastructure, a real world scenario of a distributed workflow management systems will be explained.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

	abstract = {In a society where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) becomes a key component to improve the quality of our daily-life, systems' complexity dramatically increases to better accommodate to an inherent complexity of users' requirements, especially when dealing with pervasive computing. This poses demanding architectural requirements such as massive decentralization and disintermediation along with self-organizing properties. This higher level of system complexity has triggered the birth of several software engineering methodologies that adopt the agent paradigm. Design patterns are a well known approach for capturing and reusing knowledge related to known solution for recurrent architectural problems. Even though the importance of patterns is growing as systems become more and more complex, their development does not keep up with the evolving requirements, as traditional agent patterns are unable to support the majority of current complex social scenarios. This work motivates the need for new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible than traditional agent patterns such as, Broker and Matchmaker. The newly suggested structure supports the dynamic nature of “Active Environment” where groups of agents are formed for service delivery and then dissolved with no central coordinating mechanism—i.e., gaining the disintermediation property. Serving as a case study, the PEACH and PIL projects have paved the way for experimenting with the new agent-based organizational structures that are more flexible and more suitable than traditional agent patterns for coping with ambient intelligence scenarios.},

In this work, we present an architecture for a smart home, starting from the lower device interconnectivity level up to the higher application layers that undertake the load of complex functionalities and provide a number of services to end-users. We claim that in order for smart homes to exhibit a genuinely intelligent behavior, the ability to compute compositions of individual devices automatically and dynamically is paramount. To this end, we incorporate into the architecture a composition component that employs artificial intelligence domain-independent planning to generate compositions at runtime, in a constantly evolving environment. We have implemented a fully working prototype that realizes such an architecture, and have evaluated it both in terms of performance as well as from the end-user point of view. The results of the evaluation show that the service-oriented architectural design and the support for dynamic compositions is quite efficient from the technical point of view, and that the system succeeds in satisfying the expectations and objectives of the users.},

=) Full of Interesting Ideas
- Describe the goal model processing process as a flow chart and a 1p text explaining it.
Maybe we could turn this peak in different classes for patterns:
* Goal Adaptation Patterns
* Behavior Adaptation Patterns
- Inversion of order
 
* Architecture Adaptation Patterns
- Multiplicity
- Component Selection
 
We could yet expand with:
* Organization Adaptation Pattern
 
=( Too complex
We need something more simetrical: same primitives can be used at different levels to create different levels of abstraction
 
= How our approach relates to the three peaks?
 
= Variability in Behavior
We really need to specify Behavior? It count be resolved as data dependency between tasks? (Ascendent behavior?)
AND-refinement can mean that all subtasks needs to be implemented but not that all need to succeed in order to a Goal Instance be successful. In other words, not all goals are execution entry points.
Capture adaptation by: Alternative Behaviors can lead to different success hates as exemplified in the booking example.
Multiplicity of fullfilment of a goal
(cron-like trigger for a goal)
Such a thing should be at goal-model level or should be tasks internal detail (abstracted).
With variable mulitplicity the disigner is changing static decision to feedback autoregularion. (Interesting)
Interesting discussion of a OR-refinement applied for a collection (e.g Collect Timetables tasks). The solution didnt liked the sollution presented.
* Could use a forEach refinement?
* Map-Filter-Reduce
 
= Evaluation
Describes a system developed with the proposal approach and how each peak adaptation enrich the system adaptiveness.
= Related Work
Interensting related works.
 
= How our work relate to it
it explores adaptation at goal, behavior and architecture (component selection). In didn't explore adaptation at deploymet level (moving components between computing resources).

To operate reliably, such systems should be able to adapt to new circumstances on their own. This paper describes our combined approach for adaptable software architecture and task synthesis from high-level goals, which is based on a three-layer model. In the uppermost layer, reactive plans are generated from goals expressed in a temporal logic. The middle layer is responsible for plan execution and assembling a configuration of domain-specific software components, which reside in the lowest layer. Moreover, the middle layer is responsible for selecting alternative components when the current configuration is no longer viable for the circumstances that have arisen. The implementation demonstrates that the approach enables us to handle non-determinism in the environment and unexpected failures in software components.},

	abstract = {Domotics, concerned with the realization of intelligent home environments, is a novel field which can highly benefit from solutions inspired by service-oriented principles to enhance the convenience and security of modern home residents. In this work, we present an architecture for a smart home, starting from the lower device interconnectivity level up to the higher application layers that undertake the load of complex functionalities and provide a number of services to end-users. We claim that in order for smart homes to exhibit a genuinely intelligent behavior, the ability to compute compositions of individual devices automatically and dynamically is paramount. To this end, we incorporate into the architecture a composition component that employs artificial intelligence domain-independent planning to generate compositions at runtime, in a constantly evolving environment. We have implemented a fully working prototype that realizes such an architecture, and have evaluated it both in terms of performance as well as from the end-user point of view. The results of the evaluation show that the service-oriented architectural design and the support for dynamic compositions is quite efficient from the technical point of view, and that the system succeeds in satisfying the expectations and objectives of the users.},

	abstract = {Mobile devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, have gained wide-spread popularity. These devices will increasingly be networked, thus enabling the construction of distributed applications that have to adapt to changes in context, such as variations in network bandwidth, battery power, connectivity, reachability of services and hosts, etc. In this paper, we describe CARISMA, a mobile computing middleware which exploits the principle of reflection to enhance the construction of adaptive and context-aware mobile applications. The middleware provides software engineers with primitives to describe how context changes should be handled using policies. These policies may conflict. We classify the different types of conflicts that may arise in mobile computing and argue that conflicts cannot be resolved statically at the time applications are designed, but, rather, need to be resolved at execution time. We demonstrate a method by which policy conflicts can be handled; this method uses a microeconomic approach that relies on a particular type of sealed-bid auction. We describe how this method is implemented in the CARISMA middleware architecture and sketch a distributed context-aware application for mobile devices to illustrate how the method works in practice. We show, by way of a systematic performance evaluation, that conflict resolution does not imply undue overheads, before comparing our research to related work and concluding the paper.},
