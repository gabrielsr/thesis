% In this work we choose to represent requirements in a goal oriented approach and the system structure from an architectural point of view.

To achieve a greater level of maintainability, the faul-tolerance techniques should be portable.

We also want to asses if the model is a practical solution.

As a side goal, we want to build a community around the middleware tool so we can evaluate it practical value for development of systems by third party.
