\section{Proposed Solution}

We propose a component model for goal oriented multi-agent systems and a runtime model as a solution for couple with computing environment uncertainty.

This model will be implemented by a middleware, that will keep the traceability between goals and architecture and allow for managing the architecture.

In addition we pretend to implementing fault-tolerance techniques as reusable components.
